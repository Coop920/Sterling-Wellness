You\'d think the daily dose of disease-fighting, inflammation-squelching antioxidants -- long linked with heart protection -- would be enough incentive. But wait . . . there\'s more! Lots more.</p>\n\n<strong>1. Cut Your Cancer Risk</strong>\nSeveral polyphenols -- the potent antioxidants that green tea is famous for -- seem to help keep <a title=\"Cancer Tests\" href=\"http://www.sterling-wellness.com/labs/womens-health.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>cancer</strong></a> cells from gaining a foothold in the body by discouraging growth and then suppressing the creation of new blood vessels that tumors need to thrive. Study after study has found that regularly drinking green tea reduces the risk of breast, stomach, esophagus, colon, and prostate cancer.\n\n<strong>2. Soothe Your Skin</strong>\nGot a cut, scrape, or bite, and a little leftover green tea? Soak a cotton ball in it. The tea is a natural antiseptic that relieves itching and swelling. Try it on inflamed blemishes, sunburns, or puffy eyelids. But that\'s not all. Green tea has been shown to help block sun-triggered skin cancer, whether you drink it or apply it directly to the skin -- which is why you\'re seeing green tea in more and more sunscreens and moisturizers.\n\n<strong>3. Steady Your Blood Pressure</strong>\nHaving healthy blood pressure -- meaning below 120/80 -- is one thing. Keeping it that way is quite another. But people who sip just half a cup of green tea a day are almost 50% less likely to wind up with hypertension than nondrinkers. Credit goes to the polyphenols again (especially one known as ECGC); they help keep blood vessels from contracting and raising blood pressure.\n\n<strong>4. Protect Your Memory</strong>\nGreen tea may also keep the brain from turning fuzzy. Getting-up-there adults who drink at least two cups a day are half as likely to develop cognitive problems as those who drink less. Why? It appears that the tea\'s big dose of antioxidants fights the free-radical damage to brain nerves seen in Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s.\n<strong>\n<strong>5. Stay Young</strong></strong>\nThe younger and healthier your arteries are, the younger and healthier you are. So fight plaque buildup in your blood vessels; the sticky stuff increases the risk of <a title=\"Heart Disease\" href=\"http://www.sterling-wellness.com/labs/cardiovascular-and-cholesterol.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>heart disease</strong></a> and stroke, adds years to your RealAge, and saps your energy. How much green tea does this vital job take? About 10 ounces a day, which also deters your body from absorbing artery-clogging fat and cholesterol.\n\n<strong>6. Lose Weight</strong>\nOh yeah, one more thing. Turns out that green tea speeds up your body\'s calorie-burning process. In the every-little-bit-counts department, that’s good news!\n<p align=\"center\"> </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>', 'The Benefits of drinking Green Tea', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'the-benefits-of-drinking-green-tea', '', '', '2009-07-17 18:14:39', '2009-07-17 18:14:39', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=87', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Also known as “natures candy” these tasty fruits and plentiful, versatile, and oh so delicious. Below are a few of the famous berries and their nutritional resume.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Blueberries</span></strong>- This tiny blue fruit is loaded with Vitamin C, E, and fiber. Time after time, blueberries top the charts as one of the most powerful foods for phytochemicals and antioxidants…compounds that fight off free radicals and prevent aging. Blue berries are easy to pick, and can be used in muffins, waffles, pancakes, smoothies, and eaten fresh or frozen.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Raspberries-</span></strong> Raspberries are a tender and elegant berry with a bright red hue. This fruit contains almost a day’s worth of Manganese in 1 cup. This berry also boasts of a wide variety of B vitamins such as Folate, B2, B3, and Vitamin C.  Raspberries contain anthocyanins, which contain a bit of antimicrobial properties. These anthocyanins have the ability to help prevent overgrowth of certain bacteria and fungi. One example of this includes the yeast candida albicans, a bacteria that has been linked to irritable bowel syndrome and yeast infections.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Strawberries-</span></strong> This red heart shaped fruit is the perfect treat for your heart. This prominent Missouri berry is packed with two flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol. Studies have shown that these flavoniods do your heart a favor by keeping the bad cholesterol (LDL) from damaging artery walls. One cup of strawberries also contains a whopping 140% of your DV for Vitamin C. These berries are great for jams, smoothies, pie, and salads.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Blackberries- </span></strong>Frozen, canned, or straight off the vine, blackberries are good for more than turning your mouth purple. Blackberries rank among the top of the charts for fiber content. They also contain high levels of ellagic acid and tannins which have been shown to decrease the risk of certain cancers, and reverse some effects of aging.', 'Berry Good and Good for You!', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'berry-good-and-good-for-you', '', '', '2011-05-16 08:00:04', '2011-05-16 08:00:04', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=263', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Over a decade later, Sterling Wellness Solutions is a full-service wellness company serving the national market. We remain dedicated to reducing the costs of healthcare by educating employees and their dependents about how to manage their health risk factors and motivating positive change.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'History', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '18-revision-3', '', '', '2012-09-24 16:56:36', '2012-09-24 16:56:36', '', '18', 'http://delica.websitewelcome.com/~sterling/18-revision-3/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Those who are physically inactive are twice as likely to develop heart disease than regularly active people.\r\n\r\n• If food prices had risen at the same rates as medical inflation since the 1930\'s, we would be paying an outrageous amount for common grocery items:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>1 dozen eggs $ 80.20</li>\r\n	<li>1 pound sugar $ 13.70</li>\r\n	<li>1 roll toilet tissue $ 24.20</li>\r\n	<li>1 dozen oranges $ 107.90</li>\r\n	<li>1 pound bacon $ 122.48</li>\r\n	<li>Beef $ 43.57/lb</li>\r\n	<li>Coffee $ 64.17/lb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n• Of all cancer-related deaths, almost 25–30% are due to tobacco, and as many as 30–35% are linked to diet.\r\n\r\n• Just three chronic conditions — asthma, diabetes and hypertension — are associated with 164 million lost workdays per year, at a cost to employers of $30 billion.\r\n\r\n• Obesity-related diseases account for an estimated $147 billion a year—half financed through Medicare and Medicaid.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Might be adding some positive facts.</span>\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\nAmerican Institute for Preventive Medicine, 2007\r\n\r\nThe Wellness Council of America 2011, “Making the Case for Workplace Wellness Programs”\r\n\r\nThe American Heart Association\r\n\r\nShapeUp 2011 Employer Wellness Survey\r\n\r\nNational Institute of Health\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Workplace Health Facts', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '44-revision-6', '', '', '2012-08-28 16:51:23', '2012-08-28 16:51:23', '', '44', 'http://delica.websitewelcome.com/~sterling/44-revision-6/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

It’s no secret to an employer that healthy employees are more productive employees. Recent changes and record breaking costs in the American healthcare system have left business owners and corporate employers searching for solutions to improve the health and attendance of their employees. Consider this; almost one-third of today’s workforce will become disabled before they retire. The large majority will be from preventable diseases like cancer and heart disease.\r\n\r\nCreating a likable shift in your company’s culture requires a strategic plan, senior level support, and time. Sterling Wellness Solutions is here to help guide your decision-making process as we partner to create a culture of well-being. We don’t let our efforts stop when the workday ends. Employees become motivated to transfer wellness practices, thoughts and habits into their home lives as well.\r\n\r\nAs a leader in your organization, you want to impact the bottom line while providing a positive and rewarding environment for employees. Wellness can do both. Studies further indicate that long-term, wellness initiatives can provide a 3:1 return for every dollar invested in wellness. Sterling Wellness Solutions can provide customized programs that help build a culture of wellness within your organization.

One diet does not fit all. Men and women have different nutritional needs and body types. Up to about age 10, caloric needs for boys and girls are about the same, but then puberty triggers change. By following these five steps (and by consulting with a registered dietitian), you\'ll be on your way to a healthier and possibly longer life.\n\n<strong>1. Eat moderate amounts of a variety of foods.</strong> No single food has all (or enough) of the more than 40 nutrients you need. That\'s why variety is so important. Follow My Pyramid to help select what foods and portions you should consume.\n\n<strong>2. Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. </strong>That doesn\'t mean eliminating meat, butter, cheese or egg yolks from your diet. It means you should diversify and focus on lower-fat foods. Cut the fat by:\n\n· Choosing low-fat or nonfat milk and milk products, lean meat, fish, skinless poultry, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and foods that are baked, broiled, steamed or roasted\n\n· Limiting margarine, butter, oils, shortenings, salad dressing, whole milk, regular cheese, fried foods and rich desserts.\n\n<strong>3. Eat plenty of whole grains, vegetables and fruits.</strong> These foods supply carbohydrates and dietary fiber. The typical American man gets barely half the recommended amount of dietary fiber. Men who eat adequate amounts of fiber are less likely to suffer from constipation, hemorrhoids and diverticular disease. These foods also help control blood <strong><a title=\"Cholesterol\" href=\"http://www.sterling-wellness.com/labs/cardiovascular-and-cholesterol.html\" target=\"_blank\">cholesterol</a></strong> levels and may reduce the risk of colon cancer. Adult men younger than 50 years old should consume 38 grams of fiber daily and men over the age of 50 should aim for 30 grams of fiber daily.\n\n<strong>4. Shake the sodium and salt habit.</strong> Read food labels to find foods that are lower in sodium.\n\n<strong>5. If you drink alcohol, moderation is the key. </strong>Alcoholic beverages are loaded with calories and offer few nutrients. For men, have no more than two drinks a day for optimal health. A single drink equals 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.', 'Weekly Health Tips for week beginning on June 8th', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'weekly-health-tips-for-week-beginning-on-june-8th', '', '', '2009-06-09 20:33:21', '2009-06-09 20:33:21', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=76', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Here are some tips to avoid food poisoning caused by germs growing too quickly in the summer heat.\n\n<strong>Wash your hands and forearms thoroughly before preparing or serving food</strong>. Use warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds.\n<h2>While You Are Cooking…</h2>\n<h3>Meats must be cooked to the proper temperature to assure safety.</h3>\n<em>Germs such as E-coli and salmonella can still be present in undercooked meats such as hamburger and chicken. These germs can cause severe illness and even death.</em>\n\nWhile the juice color will usually change from red to gray when the meat is fully cooked, it is not a reliable test to assure it is safe to eat. Always check the temperature with a meat thermometer. Foods that reach the temperature listed or higher are fully cooked.\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Chicken</td>\n<td>165<sup>o</sup> F</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hamburger</td>\n<td>160<sup>o</sup> F</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pork</td>\n<td>150<sup>o</sup> F</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hot dogs</td>\n<td>140<sup>o</sup> F</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leftovers</td>\n<td>165<sup>o</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eggs</td>\n<td>145<sup>o</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other foods</td>\n<td>140<sup>o</sup></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<strong>Insert</strong> the thermometer into the center of the meat, which is the least cooked part. For checking hot dogs, go from the end of the hot dog to the center. Be careful not to pass through the meat and touch the cooking surface or you will get a false high temperature reading.\n\n<strong>Wash</strong> your hands after touching raw meat! Use utensils to handle the cooked meat. Do not place cooked meat on surfaces that had raw meat.\n<h2>While You Are Serving Food…</h2>\n<strong>Serve</strong> the first-cooked meats first. Make sure the food is used before the temperature drops under 140 degrees, and within two hours. Cold foods need to be kept cold. Keep them refrigerated (at 40<sup>o</sup> F) or stored in coolers with lots of ice until ready to eat.\n\n<strong>Before</strong> serving, wash your hands thoroughly. Avoid touching food such as rolls, bread etc. with your bare hands. Wash your hands after touching raw or undercooked foods.\n\n<strong>Use</strong> a utensil when serving food.\n\n<strong>Refrigerate</strong> any leftovers immediately! Never leave food at room temperature for more than two hours.\n<h2>Whenever Working With Food…</h2>\n<strong>Leave</strong> the food preparation area to smoke, eat, or drink.\n\n<strong>When</strong> you return, wash your hands thoroughly before handling any food.\n\n<strong>Wash</strong> your hands after any contact with unclean surfaces — after handling trash or raw meat, eating or smoking, using the bathroom, handling pets, or dirtying your hands during any activity.\n<h2>A Few More Tips…</h2>\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Wipe</strong> surfaces often, especially after using them for food preparation. Germs from undercooked meat can grow on vegetables cut or washed on the same surface as the meat. Mix and use a sanitizer solution of one capful of chlorine bleach per gallon of water for cleaning work area surfaces.</li>\n	<li><strong>Marinate</strong> food in the refrigerator. Don’t taste the marinade or re-use it after raw meat has been added.</li>\n	<li><strong>Keep</strong> flies away! Cover trash containers, and do not store meat wrappers and other trash, even for a short time, in open cardboard boxes or uncovered containers.</li>\n	<li><strong>Do not</strong> use fly spray or “No-Pest” chemical strips - they can contaminate the food.</li>\n	<li><strong>Do not</strong> store food containers out in the open; rather, place them in the shade.</li>\n	<li><strong>Keep</strong> plates, cups, utensils and food covered until ready to use.</li>\n	<li><strong>Never</strong> re-use plates before washing them, especially plates used to hold raw meats or eggs.</li>\n	<li><strong>Use</strong> a separate cutting board or surface for foods that will not be cooked (such as salad).</li>\n	<li><strong>When</strong> handling plates, cups and utensils, touch them where food will not be placed: use handles, rims, bottom of plates, etc.</li>\n	<li><strong>Tie</strong> long hair back in a pony tail or bun. A hat, bandanna or net will also work.</li>\n	<li><strong>Don’t</strong> prepare and serve food if you have been sick with vomiting or diarrhea within the past 24 hours.</li>\n	<li><strong>Don’t</strong> wear loose finger or wrist jewelry or false nails while working with food.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Pack</strong> plenty of paper towels for cleaning hands and surfaces at your picnic.', 'Barbecue Food Safety Tips', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'barbecue-food-safety-tips', '', '', '2009-07-17 18:03:29', '2009-07-17 18:03:29', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=84', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Nutrition expert <a href=\"http://www.lisahark.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa Hark PhD, RD</a>, director of the Nutrition Education and Prevention Program at the University Of Pennsylvania School Of Medicine, certainly thinks so. Dr. Hark explained to me how diet and other smart lifestyle choices will help you to avoid the sniffles, stuffy nose and aches of the cold, as well as the outright misery of influenza.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hark, food and healthy lifestyle choices boost your immune system, and that can prevent you from coming down with colds and flu. The key is not waiting until you get sick to make these changes; you need to revamp your diet and lifestyle <em>before</em> the cold and flu bugs get to you.\n\nHere are Dr. Hark’s tips:\n\n<strong>Rely on Real Food, Not Vitamins</strong>\n\nFoods are better than dietary supplements for the prevention of colds and flu because you get the whole nutritional package. For example, Dr. Hark points out, eating an orange is better for you than just taking vitamin C because the orange offers you a combination of nutrients -- magnesium, potassium, folate, vitamin B6, and <a href=\"http://nutrition.about.com/od/nutritionglossary/g/antioxidants.htm\">antioxidant</a>-rich flavonoids.\n\nWhile we know that vitamin C is important for a healthy immune system, studies don’t show that taking massive doses of vitamin C helps to prevent colds and flu at all. However, we do know that eating fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C will help to keep your immune system strong. Your immune system is what protects you from viral infections, and the foods you eat have a major impact on your immune system’s ability to fight off colds and flu. The reason that fruits and vegetables do a better job of keeping your immune system ready is because they also contain vitamins A and E, as well as the flavonoids that work along side vitamin C to keep your immune system and your whole body healthy.\n\n<strong>Eat More Fruits and Vegetables</strong>\n\nSo now that you know you need to eat lots of fruits and vegetables to keep your immune system strong, the next step is to actually make it happen. People tend to eat fewer fruits and vegetables in the winter, which is the opposite of what you should be doing. Everyone needs at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day to get adequate vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants -- all things we need for a healthy immune system.\n\nOne way to increase your intake of fruits and vegetables is to incorporate juice into your diet. Not just any juice will do, though. Make sure you choose 100% juices, as other juice drinks contain extra sugar and empty calories. You can learn more about the benefits of 100% juice at the <a href=\"http://www.floridajuice.com/nutrition.php\" target=\"_blank\">Florida Department of Citrus website</a>.\n\nFor the best prices, be sure to browse your grocery store\'s produce aisle for fresh fruits and vegetables that are in-season. Oranges and grapefruits are usually cheaper in the winter, so cold and flu season is the perfect time to load up on citrus fruits.\n\nDr. Hark assures us that eating frozen fruits and vegetables is another economical and convenient way to improve your diet and prevent colds and flu. Frozen vegetable selections range from very inexpensive bags of basic peas, corn and green beans to artfully combined fruits and vegetable dishes topped with delicate sauces that you simply pop in the microwave.\n\nMake sure that fruits and vegetables are part of every meal. You can add berries or a sliced banana to your whole grain cereal at breakfast and drink a glass of 100% orange or grapefruit juice. Pack a bunch of grapes or an apple with your sandwich for lunch, and top that sandwich with tomato slices, avocado, sprouts and lettuce. Start dinner off with a salad or vegetable soup, or serve a big salad as a healthy dinner. Keep a bowl of oranges, apples and pears on your counter top to grab as quick snacks.\n\n<strong>Keep Up Your Healthy Diet</strong>\n\nWhile you want to focus on increasing the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat, don\'t forget to choose other healthy foods to supply nutrients your immune system needs. A healthy balanced diet with lean meats, fish, poultry, low-fat dairy, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds provides your body with all of the nutrients you need for general health. A healthy body tends to have a healthier immune system.\n\nProtein sources such as lean meats, dairy, eggs and legumes are especially important because they supply the amino acids that your body needs to build the components of your immune system. Lean meats also contain iron and zinc; deficiencies of these minerals can depress your immune system.\n\nOf course, avoiding unhealthy food is important too. Stay away from excess sugar and unhealthy fats, such as saturated fat and trans fats. Dr. Hark suggests being prepared by keeping healthy snacks handy so you won’t be so tempted to eat less healthy options. Try dried fruit or trail mix.\n\n<strong>What If You Do Get Sick?</strong>\n\nGood nutrition is still important if you catch a cold or influenza. Dr. Hark says that even when you are sick, you need to eat when you can. Focus on getting three meals per day, and don’t forget to keep eating lots of fruits and vegetables. It is important to get enough energy from the foods you eat while you are recuperating -- you may not be running around and exerting much, but your body is working hard to get better. Hark also stresses the importance of preventing dehydration. <a title=\"How to check fluid levels\" href=\"http://www.sterling-wellness.com/labs/general.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Drink fluids</strong></a> throughout the day such as water and 100% juices. Tired of plain water? Add a splash of juice to water or seltzer for a little variety.\n\n<strong>What Else You Can Do to Prevent Colds and Flu?</strong>\n\nEating a healthy diet is just part of the picture. Dr. Hark has other tips to help you stay healthy:\n\n<strong><em>Wash your hands.</em></strong> Your hands come in contact with germs throughout the day. The best way to get rid of them is by washing your hands thoroughly. This is an important part of food safety, too. Wash your hands before preparing meals, after handing raw meats and before serving foods. Make sure everyone at the table has washed their hands, as well.\n\n<strong><em>Get enough rest</em></strong><em>. </em><a href=\"http://www.sleepfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The National Sleep Foundation</a> tells us that most kids don’t get enough sleep, and many adults don’t either. When you don’t get enough sleep, you are more likely to get sick.\n\n<strong><em>Get your flu shots.</em></strong> Dr. Hark says that it doesn\'t matter whether you are young or old; getting a <a href=\"http://coldflu.about.com/od/vaccines/p/flushot.htm\">flu shot</a> is a good way to prevent the flu. Vaccination is even more important for the elderly and people with respiratory conditions.\n\n<strong><em>Get some exercise.</em></strong> There is strong evidence that people who exercise don\'t get sick as often. <a title=\"The Benefits of Exercise\" href=\"http://www.sterling-wellness.com/labs/cardiovascular-and-cholesterol.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Exercise</strong></a> is important all year, even in the dark and cold of winter. Dr. Hark suggests having a plan to keep active in the winter, such as walking on a treadmill, using exercise videos, jumping rope, or going to the gym. And don’t forget to bring your workout gear when you travel; many hotels have workout rooms and swimming pools.\n\nThanks to Dr. Hark\'s suggestions, getting a cold or flu doesn\'t have to be an inevitable part of winter.', 'A Secret to Help Reduce the Risks of Colds and Flu', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-secret-to-help-reduce-the-risks-of-colds-and-flu', '', '', '2009-09-28 18:51:21', '2009-09-28 18:51:21', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=111', '0', 'post', '', '0');

And it\'s no wonder. In an effort to pull off a perfect holiday, you might find yourself facing a dizzying array of demands — parties, shopping, baking, cleaning and entertaining, to name a few.

You may even end up enjoying the holidays more than you thought you would.\n\nRecognize holiday triggers\n\nLearn to recognize common holiday triggers, so you can disarm them before they lead to a meltdown:\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Relationships.</strong> Relationships can cause turmoil, conflict or stress at any time, but tensions are often heightened during the holidays. Family misunderstandings and conflicts can intensify — especially if you\'re thrust together for several days. On the other hand, facing the holidays without a loved one can be tough and leave you feeling lonely and sad.</li>\n	<li><strong>Finances.</strong> With the added expenses of gifts, travel, food and entertainment, the holidays can put a strain on your budget — and your peace of mind. Not to mention that overspending now can mean financial worries for months to come.</li>\n	<li><strong>Physical demands.</strong> Even die-hard holiday enthusiasts may find that the extra shopping and socializing can leave them wiped out. Being exhausted increases your stress, creating a vicious cycle. Exercise and sleep — good antidotes for stress and fatigue — may take a back seat to chores and errands. To top it off, burning the wick at both ends makes you more susceptible to colds and other unwelcome guests.</li>\n</ul>\nTips to prevent holiday stress and depression\n\nWhen stress is at its peak, it\'s hard to stop and regroup. Try to prevent stress and depression in the first place, especially if the holidays have taken an emotional toll on you in the past.\n<ol>\n	<li><strong>Acknowledge your feelings.</strong> If someone close to you has recently died or you can\'t be with loved ones, realize that it\'s normal to feel sadness and grief. It\'s OK to take time to cry or express your feelings. You can\'t force yourself to be happy just because it\'s the holiday season.</li>\n	<li><strong>Reach out.</strong> If you feel lonely or isolated, seek out community, religious or other social events. They can offer support and companionship. Volunteering your time to help others also is a good way to lift your spirits and broaden your friendships.</li>\n	<li><strong>Be realistic.</strong> The holidays don\'t have to be perfect or just like last year. As families change and grow, traditions and rituals often change as well. Choose a few to hold on to, and be open to creating new ones. For example, if your adult children can\'t come to your house, find new ways to celebrate together, such as sharing pictures, emails or videotapes.</li>\n	<li><strong>Set aside differences.</strong> Try to accept family members and friends as they are, even if they don\'t live up to all your expectations. Set aside grievances until a more appropriate time for discussion. And be understanding if others get upset or distressed when something goes awry. Chances are they\'re feeling the effects of holiday <a title=\"Stress, Depression, and the Holidays\" href=\"http://www.sterling-wellness.com/labs/cholesterol-blood-test.html\" target=\"_blank\">stress</a> and depression too.</li>\n	<li><strong>Stick to a budget.</strong> Before you go gift and food shopping, decide how much money you can afford to spend. Then stick to your budget. Don\'t try to buy happiness with an avalanche of gifts. Try these alternatives: Donate to a charity in someone\'s name, give homemade gifts or start a family gift exchange.</li>\n	<li><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> Set aside specific days for shopping, baking, visiting friends and other activities. Plan your menus and then make your shopping list. That\'ll help prevent last-minute scrambling to buy forgotten ingredients. And make sure to line up help for party prep and cleanup.</li>\n	<li><strong>Learn to say no.</strong> Saying yes when you should say no can leave you feeling resentful and overwhelmed. Friends and colleagues will understand if you can\'t participate in every project or activity. If it\'s not possible to say no when your boss asks you to work overtime, try to remove something else from your agenda to make up for the lost time.</li>\n	<li><strong>Don\'t abandon healthy habits.</strong> Don\'t let the holidays become a free-for-all. Overindulgence only adds to your stress and guilt. Have a healthy snack before holiday parties so that you don\'t go overboard on sweets, cheese or drinks. Continue to get plenty of sleep and physical activity.</li>\n	<li><strong>Take a breather.</strong> Make some time for yourself. Spending just 15 minutes alone, without distractions, may refresh you enough to handle everything you need to do. Take a walk at night and stargaze. Listen to soothing music. Find something that reduces stress by clearing your mind, slowing your breathing and restoring inner calm.</li>\n</ol>\n10.  <strong>Seek professional help if you need it.</strong> Despite your best efforts, you may find yourself feeling persistently sad or anxious, plagued by physical complaints, unable to sleep, irritable and hopeless, and unable to face routine chores. If these feelings last for a while, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional.\n\nTake control of the holidays\n\nDon\'t let the holidays become something you dread.

One specific form of inherited high cholesterol that affects 1 in 500 people is familial hypercholesterolemia, which often leads to early heart disease. But even if you do not have a specific genetic form of high cholesterol, genes play a role in influencing your LDL-cholesterol level. </strong>\n\n<strong>What You Eat.</strong><strong> Two main nutrients in the foods you eat make your LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol level go up: saturated fat, a type of fat found mostly in foods that come from animals; and cholesterol, which comes only from animal products. Saturated fat raises your LDL-cholesterol level more than anything else in the diet. Eating too much saturated fat and cholesterol is the main reason for high levels of cholesterol and a high rate of heart attacks in the United States. Reducing the amount of saturated fat and cholesterol you eat is a very important step in reducing your blood cholesterol levels. </strong>\n\n<strong>Weight.</strong><strong> Excess weight tends to increase your LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol level. If you are </strong><strong>overweight and have a high LDL-cholesterol level, losing weight may help you lower it.

Doctors don\'t know for certain whether alcohol also reduces the risk of heart disease. Drinking too much alcohol can damage the liver and heart muscle, lead to high blood pressure, and raise triglycerides. Because of the risks, alcoholic beverages should not be used as a way to prevent heart disease. </strong>\n\n<strong>Stress. Stress over the long term has been shown in several studies to raise blood cholesterol levels. One way that stress may do this is by affecting your habits.

Target your triglycerides.  </strong>Shoot for a level of 150 or lower.  Triglycerides are a better marker for high risk of diabetes and heart disease.  Triglycerides are also much more responsive to lifestyle changes than other types of blood fats.\n\n<strong>3.

Walnuts will also make you feel fuller faster so you are less likely to overeat at meals. You may want to give pistachios a try as well. A recent study shows that a serving or two of pistachios each day may help reduce levels of LDL cholesterol, as long as you are mindful of calories. One cup of pistachio nuts has about 700 calories!\n\nOther nuts, such as peanuts, macadamia nuts, and almonds are a rich source of plant sterols, which block cholesterol absorption in the intestines. Studies have shown that eating foods enriched with plant sterols lowers LDL cholesterol. Eating 2-3 grams a day lowers LDL cholesterol by 6-15%, without affecting HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. Sterols are found in all plant foods, but the highest concentrations are found in unrefined oils, such as vegetable, nut, and olive oil. Some foods have also been fortified with plant sterols, including milk, yogurt, juices, and spreads.\n\n<strong>4.</strong> <strong>De-stress your heart.  </strong>Unplug yourself from the news cycle and your email. It’s good for you and your ticker.  Stress raises blood pressure, heart rate, and levels of the stress hormone cortisol.  Consider swapping your BlackBerry for another handheld gadget -- your iPod.  Put some relaxing music on your iPod, close your office door for 10 minutes, and listen and breathe.\n\n<strong>5. Get heart healthy social support.  </strong>You know exercise improves heart health by keeping weight down and raising levels of HDL cholesterol, but doing it with a friend adds benefits. Finding an exercise buddy is really important because social support lowers your risk of heart disease and helps you stay motivated.   Build up to 60 minutes of exercise a day, but even 20 minutes is better than nothing.\n\nIn fact, being married and having a strong social network may help protect against heart disease, according to a study of nearly 15,000 men and women.

Take a heart-felt approach to quitting smoking.  </strong>Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease, but kicking this nasty habit can be much easier said than done.  Secondhand smoke counts too. A recent study found that women who are exposed to other people’s smoke increased their risk of heart attacks by 69%, strokes by 56%, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) by 67%, when compared with women who did not hang out around smokers. Clogged arteries in the legs, abdomen, pelvis, arms, and neck are linked with PAD.\n\n 7<strong>. Strengthen your heart with weight training.  </strong>Strength training reduces your percentage of body fat, keeps your weight down, and increases your muscle mass and endurance for aerobic exercise.\n\n<strong>8. Reduce your blood pressure by reducing your salt.  </strong>High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease, and reducing salt intake can help lower blood pressure. Cook with herbs in place of salt, and make sure you read food labels to see just how much salt is in prepared foods.\n\n<strong>9. Sleep to your heart’s content.  </strong>People who sleep fewer than seven hours a night have higher blood pressure and higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol, making the arteries more vulnerable to plaque buildup. In fact, the latest research shows that people who do not get enough sleep are more than twice as likely as others to die of heart disease.

Instead of failing to keep those resolutions two weeks after they were made, try making them a lifestyle change instead. Follow the tips below to begin a lifetime of vibrant health and wellness once and for all.\n\n1)       Make your health goal something YOU want to do, not something your boss, spouse, or friend wants you to do. Keep the focus on what you want to desire from these goals such as confidence, happiness, or more energy.\n\n 2)      Make small changes one step at a time. Instead of attempting a sweeping change with lofty goals, try making incremental steps that build on each other. For example, if you want to start exercising, don’t attempt to run a marathon if you aren’t a runner. Rather increase your workouts by 5-10 minutes each week until you have reached a desired duration.\n\n 3)      Write it down! Keep track of your progress in a journal or a piece of paper. This serves as a visual reminder of how far you have come. Post reminders and encouragements on your refrigerator, bulletin board, and bathroom mirror. For added accountability, tell a friend.\n\n 4)      Avoid the <em>‘do not’s’</em> and stick to the ‘<em>do’s</em>.’ No one wants to follow a restrictive laundry list of things they shouldn’t do; don’t drink soda, don’t smoke, don’t eat dessert.  Focus on your goals in a positive light instead; drink more water, take stretch breaks at work, eat more fruits and vegetables. These positive behaviors will cascade into healthy habits that won’t make you feel restrained.\n\nThis year, make a life-long resolution to maintain habits of health and wellness.  Eat, drink, and be healthy in 2011!', 'Happy New You!', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'happy-new-you', '', '', '2011-01-05 15:24:38', '2011-01-05 15:24:38', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=162', '0', 'post', '', '0');

When prepared without the showering of butter and coating of salt, popcorn can actually be very nutritious! It\'s rare that a snack food would get \"healthy\" stamp of approval. Read on to see why.\n\n•Popcorn is a <em><strong>whole grain</strong></em>, just like oatmeal or brown rice. Because of its whole grain properties, popcorn keeps it\'s vitamin and mineral content within its bran unlike that of a refined grain where its bran and germ are stripped away. \n\n•Because of its whole grain properties, popcorn is high in <em><strong>fiber</strong></em>. A three cup serving of popcorn contains about 4 grams of fiber. Fiber can help satisfy hunger, keep you fuller longer, and also decrease cholesterol.\n\n•Recent studies suggest popcorn is high in <em><strong>antioxidants</strong></em>, specifically polyphenols.  The polyphenols in popcorn are similar to the disease fighting ingredients also found in red wine, dark chocolate, and green tea. These antioxidants can prevent chronic diseases such as cancer and also reduce damage from free radicals.\n\n•Popcorn is a <em><strong>low-calorie</strong></em> snack. Three cups of air popped popcorn contains around 90 calories. Just beware in how you prepare or order it. Butter, caramel, salt, and cheese toppings can all add a hefty amount of unwanted fat, calories, and sodium.\n\nCelebrate National Popcorn Day today by popping up some of America’s healthiest snack!', 'Celebrate National Popcorn Day!', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'celebrate-national-popcorn-day', '', '', '2011-01-19 08:00:27', '2011-01-19 08:00:27', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=186', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Every minute, someone dies from it.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Know your risks:</span></strong> You may be at an elevated risk for heart disease if you are overweight, smoke, have diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure.

Reduce the amount of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet, which often come from animal sources such as high fat dairy products and meat.

Because fruit is often higher in sugar, most adults only need 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit a day. Avoid fruit juice drinks and cocktails that aren’t 100% fruit juice. Fruit makes a great snack, so grab some grapes, apple slices, or berries and snack away!\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Dairy</span></strong>- Dairy products tend to be high in protein and other essential nutrients, but can also be high in fat.

For example an 8 oz long island iced tea contains around 780 calories. An 8oz margarita can contain around 740 calories. And let’s not forget everyone’s favorite beachside drink, the pina colada. Beware of its small size. This 6 oz fruity drink can contain up to 640 calories.\n\n<strong>Increased cancer risk</strong>: Because alcohol is a toxin, the walls of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach are at an increased risk for cancer. Studies have also linked alcohol consumption to higher risks of breast, colon, and liver cancer.\n\n<strong>Excess fat storage</strong>: Alcohol is metabolized in the body similar to a fat. The liver converts alcohol bi-products into fatty acids which are then stored in the liver or stored in other tissues. When more alcohol enters the body than the liver can metabolize, one’s blood will become saturated causing intoxication. This build up of stored fatty acids is what can lead to the well known “beer-belly” syndrome. \n\nhttp://www.naadd.org/', 'Rethink Your Drink', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'rethink-your-drink', '', '', '2011-04-15 08:00:07', '2011-04-15 08:00:07', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=254', '0', 'post', '', '0');

You be the judge. Many foods claim to be organic or made with organic ingredients, but what does that even mean?\n\nSince 2002, the USDA has set standards that food manufacturers must adhere to if they label their product as organic. An inspector from the USDA must examine farmers, their animals, animal feed, soils, and growing practices to determine if their final product can be labeled as organic. Organic foods are free from pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic ingredients, dyes, and growth hormones. Produce grown in organic soil has been shown to have more nutrients due to the nutrient rich soil. Pesticides, chemicals, and growth hormones have been linked to many conditions such as cancers, food allergies and ADHD.\n\nGenerally speaking, you typically don’t need to pay the extra cash for produce with thick skins or rinds that get pealed or aren’t eaten. This includes bananas, melons, pineapple, broccoli, and mango. However, it may be worth shelling out a few extra bucks for milk, meat, eggs, and produce with thin skins such as berries, peaches, and bell peppers.\n\nAlthough you may pay more, there are cheaper alternatives such as joining a farmers co-op, buying locally, or shopping at farmers markets.

Dating back to Biblical times, populations were instructed to avoid eating unclean animals. Although the idea of clean eating has evolved slightly, it is still a highly sought after and recommended way of eating.\n\nClean eating recommends limiting or completely <strong>eliminating highly processed and packaged foods</strong> that are likely high in chemicals, fillers, food dyes. It encourages nutrient dense foods grown out of the ground and from plants.  A clean eating diet contains <strong>plenty of whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables (organic when possible), low fat dairy products, and lean clean meats</strong>. Eating clean includes drinking plenty of filtered water while <strong>avoiding soda, sugary drinks, and alcohol</strong>.\n\nAlthough this concept may be daunting to some, it is best to start small. Begin incorporating clean foods into just one meal a day and work your way up. Slowly rid your cabinets of processed and packaged foods. <strong>Learn to read food labels</strong>; generally speaking, the shorter an ingredient list is, the better. Avoid products that contain ingredients that you can\'t pronounce. The further the food is from its natural state, the more ‘dirty’ it is considered (think fresh organic strawberries vs. strawberry poptarts).\n\n<strong><em>Browse </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.cleaneatingmag.com/\"><strong><em>Clean Eating recipes</em></strong></a><strong><em> and learn more about the </em></strong><a href=\"http://eatcleandiet.com/what_is_the_eat-clean_diet.aspx\"><strong><em>Eat Clean diet</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong>', 'Clean Eating', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'clean-eating', '', '', '2011-08-02 04:00:37', '2011-08-02 04:00:37', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=354', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Women in their 20s and 30s should have a clinical breast exam as part of their physical screening every one to three years. Finally, women 40 and older should have a mammogram every year.\n\nThere are many lifestyle factors you can follow to help prevent breast cancer.

The antioxidants in cocoa powder show up in highest amounts in unprocessed chocolate.\n\nMany pre-packaged hot cocoa mixes made from milk solids don\'t contain as many antioxidants and flavonoids as pure dark cocoa powder.

Instead of failing to keep those resolutions two weeks after they were made, try making them a lifestyle change instead. Follow the tips below to begin a lifetime of vibrant health and wellness once and for all.\n\n1)       Make your health goal something YOU want to do, not something your boss, spouse, or friend wants you to do. Keep the focus on what you want to desire from these goals such as confidence, happiness, or more energy.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sterling-wellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Set-Goals-Chalkboard.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-527 alignright\" title=\"Set Goals Chalkboard\" src=\"http://www.sterling-wellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Set-Goals-Chalkboard-300x235.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"193\" height=\"149\" /></a>2)      Make small changes one step at a time. Instead of attempting a sweeping change with lofty goals, try making incremental steps that build on each other. For example, if you want to start exercising, don’t attempt to run a marathon if you aren’t a runner. Rather increase your workouts by 5-10 minutes each week until you have reached a desired duration.\n\n3)      Write it down! Keep track of your progress in a journal or a piece of paper. This serves as a visual reminder of how far you have come. Post reminders and encouragements on your refrigerator, bulletin board, and bathroom mirror. For added accountability, tell a friend.\n\n4)      Avoid the <em>‘do not’s’</em> and stick to the ‘<em>do’s</em>.’ No one wants to follow a restrictive laundry list of things they shouldn’t do; don’t drink soda, don’t smoke, don’t eat dessert.  Focus on your goals in a positive light instead; drink more water, take stretch breaks at work, eat more fruits and vegetables. These positive behaviors will cascade into healthy habits that won’t make you feel restrained.\n\nThis year, make a life-long resolution to maintain habits of health and wellness.  Eat, drink, and be healthy in 2012!', 'Healthy Weight Month', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'healthy-weight-month', '', '', '2012-01-09 19:30:07', '2012-01-09 19:30:07', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=526', '0', 'post', '', '0');

After this strength building workout, cool down with a few  flexibility stretches. Start by stretching your head/neck first then  move down the body with shoulder rolls, torso and hip stretches.  Finally, end with a lower body stretch to the quads, calves, and ankles.  To track improvement, log your repetitions and increase duration and  frequency each week.

Physical activity has been proven to prevent and treat chronic diseases so drastically that many doctors have been able to take their patients off prescription medications. According to the ACSM, research proves that exercise has a role in the treatment and prevention of more than 40 chronic diseases. It\'s no surprise to learn heart disease and hypertension are two conditions considerably affected by exercise. Physical activity, particularly cardiovascular exercise, has been shown to reduce blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglycerides while increasing HDL (good) cholesterol levels.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise each week. This calculates out to 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Include activities such as brisk walking, water aerobics, or riding a bike into your daily schedule for a lower risk for heart disease and hypertension.

Colon cancer is the third leading cause of death due to cancer in America. The American Cancer Society recommends all people over the age of 50 get a colonoscopy every 10 years. Knowing your family history may determine if you need a colonoscopy before the age of 50. If you or someone in your immediate family has a history of inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, or digestive problems, a colonoscopy may be recommended at an earlier age. During a colonoscopy screening, the doctor is able to remove polyps or pre-cancerous lesions and send them off for a biopsy. Polyps are generally benign in early stages, but if left undetected, they may grow into cancer. If an abnormal test is returned, a patient may be asked to have a repeat colonoscopy in two to five years.

This convenient exercise can be performed almost anywhere, from living room floors to office cubicles. As we age, our muscles naturally lose flexibility and mobility, increasing our need to stretch regularly. Some of the greatest benefits from stretching include a reduced chance of major joint replacement surgeries of the knees, hips, and shoulders. Stretching can decrease the risk of back injuries and workplace traumas like carpel tunnel, tendonitis, and tennis elbow. As if that\'s not argument enough to get flexible, frequent stretching can even reduce the risk of developing osteoarthritis or stiffness and pain in joints, the #1 cause of disability worldwide.

Find an activity you enjoy, and schedule it into your calendar. Exercise burns anxious energy and releases feel good endorphins to improve your mood. There\'s a reason they call it the \'runner\'s high.\'\n\n<strong>Choose and Lose-</strong> Choose your priorities wisely, and lose the rest. Write down the things that matter most to you and rank them in\n\norder of which ones deserve your most attention. Determine what is important to you, and don\'t get stressed out over the things that aren\'t.\n\n<strong>\nPractice Stress Relaxation Techniques-</strong> Deep breathing, yoga, mindful meditation, and prayer can all clear the mind of clutter. Consider setting an alarm or chime to go off every hour as a reminder to take 5-10 slow deep breaths, and do slow neck and shoulder stretches to relax tension.\n\nFor more information on stress relaxation techniques, visit the <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001e0BjQliEB_Qj_dFaQvi1s-l6maZYvnt1XHgnJJNtnihFNTCDC_nn0wQYgDZzYAe4HoI6F4SYIrgW9yXxx0EUR8TxT5rSUQ-6-nUP9zDAmQi-rNovHwDRDg==\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">American Institute of Stress</a> or the <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001e0BjQliEB_R645Ud0MzF1b8WBsiCEJP_dwmWfhT7vIQcwf6mA0GNKpwU4fRC22hsYLQwmVt_MuTopFCYvFb2uY7SO_D1YSh8meanjTR7p8B43j6oNNKmZf4IV8tk9q4rrlhIzpjhRLqpJPPUivi1U02K-PohJor3b5_GF43LYlw=\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Mayo Clinic.</a>', 'Relief for the Over-Stressed; April is Stress Awareness Month', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'relief-for-the-over-stressed-april-is-stress-awareness-month', '', '', '2012-04-03 15:21:41', '2012-04-03 15:21:41', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=615', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Although children (and adults!) are drawn to high sugar, high fat, artificially colored food-like substances, try introducing healthier options of snack items and toys in lieu of candy and chocolate. Children are taught by example, so encouraging healthy behaviors at a young age can create a lifetime of positive health habits. Offering kids toys that encourage movement is a great choice. Consider giving games, sports equipment, or puzzles. Sidewalk chalk, sunglasses, and a new swim suit can get a child anticipating the warm months ahead.

Many people find the winter months with it\'s cold, overcast days can make the symptoms worse. Exercise is a great way to beat the \'winter blues\'. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins, a chemical found in your brain. When these endorphins are released the body begins to feel more relaxed, less stressed and a more optimistic outlook on life. Most people who take time to exercise also report better sleep patterns. Getting a good night\'s sleep will greatly affect your outlook on the day in a positive way.\n\nExercise can also increase life expectancy. Exercising for 30 minutes a day most days of the week will strengthen your heart, increase your energy levels, and decrease your chances of getting diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.  Everyone can feel better knowing they are adding years to their life with exercise.\n\nDepression and anxiety can be difficult to control at times.

Several conditions can cause similar side effects, but one possibility is a thyroid disorder.\n\nThe thyroid is a gland in the front of the neck that produces hormones to keep the metabolism working properly. Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid cannot make enough thyroid hormones to keep the body functioning as it normally should, therefore slowing down the metabolism. Symptoms of an under-active thyroid include constant fatigue, despite getting the proper amount of sleep, difficulty staying focused, weight gain for no obvious reason, dry skin or brittle hair, and depression.\n\nConversely, the thyroid can also make too much thyroid hormone causing hyperthyroidism. The higher levels of thyroid hormone production leads to the body\'s metabolism working too fast. Grave\'s disease and goiter are common forms. Symptoms include heart palpitations, feeling nervous, weight loss for no reason, hand tremors, perspiration at rest, and bulging eyes.\n\nIf you have one or more of these symptoms that persist, notify your physician. Contrary to some beliefs, thyroid disorders occur in men as well as women. Treatment depends on the symptoms and severity of the condition.

It\'s important to take extra precautions to protect our body\'s largest organ from the sun\'s damaging rays. Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. Up to 90% of visible skin changes from aging are due to the sun\'s UV rays. Take care of your skin this summer by following these skin-saving tips:\n<ul>\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Save your Skin</span>- Be generous with an SPF of 15 or higher that offers protection against UVA and UVB rays. It takes approximately one ounce of sunscreen to cover an entire body. That\'s roughly the size of a golf ball or shot glass.</li>\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Take Cover</span>- Find a wide brimmed hat to protect your ears and neck. Since the sun\'s rays can penetrate through clothes, find an extra layer of protection from a hat, umbrella, or tree.</li>\n	<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ban the Bed</span>- Tanning beds are a proven risk for developing skin cancer. For men and women wanting a sun kissed glow, opt for spay or self tanners.</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Protect your Peepers</span>- Sun can damage eyes, leading to increased risk of cataracts, a damaged retina, or chances of skin cancer on the eyelids.

There are pros and cons to each method. Although they are each appropriate for certain readings, one must also take into consideration physical activity, eating habits, and lifestyle factors as well. Being \"healthy\" is not making the grade on a body composition screening, but rather getting a sense of the whole picture through other evaluations as well.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Body Mass Index (BMI)-</span> BMI is a ratio of your weight to your height. This is a good indicator of a healthy weight range, but does not work well for people with muscular builds. Since muscle weighs more than fat, those with high lean body mass can register in the overweight category.  Generally speaking, BMI is a good approximation to determine if your weight is a healthy range for your height. To determine if you are in a healthy weight range, <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001MvkEXPYjURjl34SM09vi4RKS5Y3rP9J876h701onndX-tPauRQ7BQu1DtqNuEoD0ujhI4re9WtBXIVXEhBPDcV7v1xzopqi-ftkA_whNbTV3JSBZkH9HR0r6-uPZc4BrGvJwaLkX_rm9RuErJD5wS7ItZ72ofqQizhHpC37Crsg=\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">calculate your BMI here</a>.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Body Fat Percentage</span>- We are able to measure the percentage of fat composition in the body by sending a weak electrical current through your arms (measuring only upper body fat) or through your legs (measuring only lower body fat). Both methods fail to measure abdominal fat, the most important indicator of health status. The results of this bioelectrical impedance method we use varies greatly depending on hydration status, recent exercise, and food consumption. The most accurate way to measure true body fat is through underwater weighing or a DEXA scan.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Waist to Hip Ratio-</span>  By taking the waist circumference and dividing it by the hip circumference, one can determine health risks according to fat distribution.  When fat is distributed around the abdominal area, such as in \"apple\" shape body types, the risk for chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension increases. To calculate your Waist to Hip ratio, <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001MvkEXPYjURi5kXN7IWidgP3qHphgtCs2LPnEOFgERMI2_zFouYSP1aEw9QKgtxohHxEMDPRVdZjmbdv4HES6m8a-6chgI7Jvf4fsUsknykzPEPeXc4Q_3DfnZve2E3v1vLEZpIE8FVgleuFbI4M9b5FKduoTpSmF\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.\n\nWhile all three methods of screening are important, we must not reduce one\'s health to the result of one test.

If you have an abnormal PSA result, you should talk to your doctor! An abnormal PSA can be due to several factors the <em>least</em> common of which is prostate cancer. The most common cause is prolonged pressure or trauma to the prostate gland, such as prolonged driving, horseback riding, lawn mowing etc., followed closely by benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) which is a benign and medically treatable disease.  Your physician should conduct a digital rectal examination.

Although iced tea\'s southern counterpart is typically laden with sugar, there are many health benefits to traditional unsweetened tea. When brewed from fresh leaves or tea bags, this thirst quenching beverage contains many beneficial antioxidants and flavonoids. White tea, green tea, and black tea all vary in flavor, caffeine content, and beneficial compounds. White tea has been shown to have more anticancer and antiviral properties than green or black teas. Studies have shown green tea to be a heart healthy beverage of choice for lowering the risk of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the artery walls from heart disease. The green variety has also been praised for its anti-aging benefits and ability to stabilize blood sugar levels. Generally speaking, black tea contains the most caffeine, followed by green tea and then white tea.\n\nTo reap the most health benefits from iced tea, avoid adding sugar. Instead opt for a lemon or lime slice, or mint leaf. This summer, enjoy freshly brewed unsweetened tea, and feel good about the health benefits you are delivering to your body.

Also known as the \"sunshine vitamin,\" this nutrient can be synthesized in our skin from sun exposure and is also found in foods such as fish, egg yolks, and fortified milk. Although this fat soluble vitamin has long been known to keep bones strong, recent studies prove it\'s much more than that. Vitamin D acts as an immune enhancer. This vitamin may boost your immune system and protect you against ailments such as the common cold and flu. A study by the Cancer Treatment Centers of America suggests vitamin D can even play a role in preventing colon, breast, and prostate cancer. A recent Harvard Medical Study found vitamin D can also reduce the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms and also keep your brain sharper longer into life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut just how much should you be getting? The NIH recommends 600IU of vitamin D for all adults age 18-70. Depending on geographic location and season, many people can get their required dose of vitamin D from 15-30 minutes of sunlight on exposed skin. Additional dietary sources include cod liver oil, yogurt, and orange juice.

Also known as \"natures candy\" these tasty fruits are plentiful, versatile, and oh so delicious. Blueberries in particular are a tiny blue fruit loaded with Vitamin C, E, and fiber.\n\nTime after time, blueberries top the charts as one of the most powerful foods for phytochemicals and antioxidants. These compounds fight off free radicals and prevent aging. Blueberries are easy to pick, and can be used in muffins, waffles, pancakes, smoothies, and eaten fresh or frozen.

Dripping with sweet juice and iconic of late summer, this fruit has as many different varieties as there are ways to prepare them. In the United States alone, over 300 varieties of peaches are grown. This nutritious fruit contains vitamins A and C, both essential for a strong immune system and healthy vision. A medium size peach has approximately 40 calories, making it a perfect portion.\n\nPeaches can be a nutritious addition to many favorite dishes. Try peach salsa, topping a salad with peach chunks, or a peach marinade for chicken or pork. A few slices of peach can jazz up a glass of ice water or unsweetened tea. Although peaches are sweet enough on their own, they make a great topper for a small scoop of low fat ice cream on a hot summer night.

The American Heart Association recommends people eat fish high in omega-3 fatty acids at least twice a week. Consuming two servings of this type of fat has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, inflammation, and even triglycerides.\n\nSalmon, tuna, and herring contain the most omega-3\'s, however other fish such as cod and sardines still offer similar heart protective benefits. When preparing fish, much of the health benefits are dependent on how it is prepared. Grilling or baking fish is generally recommended over frying. Fish is a great source of lean protein, helping you feel fuller longer than other foods. When considering portions, remember that one serving of fish is approximately 3 ounces, or about the size of a deck of cards.

Studies show that dark chocolate can be good for cardiovascular health. Chocolate is derived from the cocoa bean which contains large quantities of flavonoids and antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to slow aging and prevent chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. The antioxidant levels in dark chocolate are often compared to that of blueberries and green tea. The highest amounts of antioxidants show up in dark chocolate that contains at least 70% cocoa.\r\n\r\nDark chocolate has also been shown to temporarily lower blood pressure and improve memory and cognition. One compound in chocolate releases feel-good endorphins that can boost your mood. Despite its many health benefits, be mindful of the portion size of this decadent treat. One ounce of dark chocolate can have 9 grams of fat and 150 calories.

These tiny seeds can be eaten whole, however, they are more easily digested and tolerated when ground. Whole flax seeds can easily be ground in a coffee grinder or food processor and added to many dishes. Try adding ground flax to baked goods, pasta dishes, salads, and desserts. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001uzYN78_9iw3aERqbXONP0jmQMSP6kxLXQyzET3eEf3JHZiyHKAYNAtYZs2spsLXE321dZyLO9zEfVYQ7-Fv2bTQFd3_MFHsrxOGYMY77u9WYXdOsBtAyA-pgxByYf_8kJb1De4agvNOS77sL_g-GV0jIOHPgDslf\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> for more health information and recipes containing flax.', 'Nutrition Facts on Flax   ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1549-revision-2', '', '', '2013-02-06 17:59:48', '2013-02-06 17:59:48', '', '1549', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/1549-revision-2/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Core strengthening exercises target upper and lower abdominals, back muscles, obliques, and intrinsic muscles around the spine that help with posture. Often called a stability ball, these exercise techniques can improve balance, stability, and coordination.\r\n\r\nTo size a ball that fits your body, make sure your knees are at a right angle and your feet are flat on the floor. Simply sitting on the ball with proper posture will activate rarely used core muscles that are required to maintain good form. Frequent use of a stability ball has been shown to decrease discomfort to those who suffer from back pain. Try replacing your desk chair with an ab ball for portions of your day, or sit on one while watching TV.\r\n\r\nFor examples of core strengthening exercises on an fitness ball, view this <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001aFzMCgwQ4dXxhKEJvy_LLmUHqMdpHlkQywowjfRL2Mfky_HSFbSqvaHDGaZOB7kY1JEPiODGq9ItohL5GHsst5PRslgJJS9GkwYRsC2rpPta4sPbvcj3lz8xQttsZN1vr3MBeqkz_VbeuCfjvD9--iEHbnV9taqQ\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">slide-show from MayoClinic</a>.', 'Your Abs will Have a Ball!

I want to be able to tell her something positive,” she states.\r\n\r\nRachel started her weight loss journey shortly after New Year’s Day in 2010. She was shopping for new clothes and became quickly discouraged when size 18 pants were all that fit. Within a year, she had dropped 45 lbs and started tracking her calorie intake and physical activity on MyFitnessPal. She was exercising regularly and still hit a weight loss plateau. “Marie gave me the best tip ever,” she proclaims. “Add strength training!” On top of her typical cardiovascular regimen at the gym, Rachel has included her own strength training circuit 4-5 days a week. Rachel admits getting to the gym is the hardest part, but then once she’s there, she makes every minute count.\r\n\r\nExercising was never as big of a struggle as eating in moderation. “I’ve always struggled with portion control,” she confesses. Rachel’s typical lunch is a deli style sandwich with as many veggies as one can stack on top; beets, carrots, spinach, tomatoes just to name a few. She’s not ashamed to admit she has a vice for chocolate and ice cream. She allows herself 1 snack size of hershey’s chocolate or a sugar free jello cup to satisfy her sweet tooth.\r\n\r\nHer biggest hurdle to overcome was to stop making excuses. With two kids, a husband, and a dog at home, Rachel had to make her health a priority. Although she has not hit her goal weight yet, she is more motivated and confident.

Most people today are trying to juggle having a family, building a career and maintaining some semblance of a personal life. These three tips will help you keep the stress from becoming unmanageable:\r\n<ol start=\"1\">\r\n	<li><strong>Deal with difficult situations ASAP-</strong> Avoiding a tough subject is one of the biggest causes of workplace stress. Don\'t wait until the boss approaches you about a problem. Take charge, and set the time and place to address it sooner rather than later. When you take control of a problem, it loses some of its stressful power over you.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Let go of some \'obligations\'-</strong> A lot of the stress we feel at work or home is a result of overbooking our lives. Learn to say no to things that aren\'t a top priority and focus on the things that are truly important.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Develop a mental list of coping skills-</strong> When the stress gets too high, stop and take action. Taking a 10 minute walk, calling a trusted friend, or practicing a mediation moment can make all the difference in reducing your stress.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nStress can build up quickly unless you make time to deal with it on a regular basis.

This citrus fruit contains roughly 5-6% citric acid, which gives lemons their tart taste. Lemon is an unmistakable flavor that is used in everything from meat tenderizing and marinating to baking and beverages. Lemons, like most citrus fruits, contain a significant amount of vitamin C. This nutrient helps fight colds, boost immunity, and even detoxify the liver.

The small juicy package is scientifically considered a fruit because it contains seeds and develops from a flower. In culinary terms, the tomato is usually referred to as a vegetable due to its use in savory, not sweet, dishes. Botany aside, tomatoes are rich in antioxidants, especially the caroteniod lycopene. Lycopene is a pigment common in red and pink produce. This compound has significant health benefits with heart health, prostate cancer prevention, and bone health.\r\n\r\nTomatoes come in hundreds of varieties, but all are high in vitamins C, A, K, and potassium. Diets that include tomatoes have been linked to lower incidences of obesity and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer\'s. Since the window for fresh tomatoes is small, canning is a great way to preserve the fruit\'s nutrients. When heated, tomatoes increase the level of phytochemicals they contain, enhancing the antioxidant content being absorbed into the body.

The small juicy package is scientifically considered a fruit because it contains seeds and develops from a flower. In culinary terms, the tomato is usually referred to as a vegetable due to its use in savory, not sweet, dishes. Botany aside, tomatoes are rich in antioxidants, especially the caroteniod lycopene. Lycopene is a pigment common in red and pink produce. This compound has significant health benefits with heart health, prostate cancer prevention, and bone health.\n\nTomatoes come in hundreds of varieties, but all are high in vitamins C, A, K, and potassium. Diets that include tomatoes have been linked to lower incidences of obesity and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer\'s. Since the window for fresh tomatoes is small, canning is a great way to preserve the fruit\'s nutrients. When heated, tomatoes increase the level of phytochemicals they contain, enhancing the antioxidant content being absorbed into the body.

Originally created as a combat sport, punching bags have made their way into gyms across the world. This exercise uses all major muscle groups and provides a high-intensity routine that promotes quick reflexes, endurance, and cardiovascular strength. Kickboxing engages the core muscles for greater stability and scorches more calories than common cardio exercises like running and the elliptical machine.\r\n\r\nProper technique and equipment is required to avoid injury. A personal trainer may be required to help you position your body and evenly distribute weight to avoid muscle and joint strain. Because boxing can be intense and taxing on the body, beginners should start slow and work their way up to longer routines. Be sure to include a warm up and cool down in your workout.

When working out at very high levels or when exercising in hot and humid conditions, your body becomes depleted of key nutrients such as potassium, magnesium and sodium, also known as electrolytes - all of which help prevent muscle fatigue and cramping.  When your body is low in these nutrients, you are more prone to weakness and heat related injuries. Sports drinks can help replenish electrolytes, fluids and carbohydrates giving you energy during and after your workout.\r\n\r\nBut what about those of us who aren\'t engaging in high intensity workouts? When exercising for 60 minutes or less at moderate levels, sports drinks can actually add an abundance of unnecessary calories and sugar. One 20 ounce bottle of Gatorade contains 34 grams of sugar - the equivalent of 9 teaspoons! These high levels of sugar can lead to unwanted weight gain, especially when consumed with moderate to low exercise. Many sports drinks also contain artificial coloring and high fructose corn syrup, both of which should be limited.\r\n\r\n<em>Bottom line</em>: Sports drinks can be essential for people engaging in prolonged periods of vigorous activity, but for everyone else the better solution is to stay hydrated with water before, during and after your workout!', 'Ask the Expert- Sports Drinks', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'ask-the-expert-sports-drinks', '', '', '2013-07-03 16:25:10', '2013-07-03 16:25:10', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=1736', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Sand offers great terrain to improve balance and stability, all with minimal joint impact. Running on sand can burn up to 30% more calories than on pavement or hard surface. Because technical movements are more challenging in the sand, athletes develop quicker reflexes and expend more energy keeping a ball in play.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to this beach-style workout, start first on wet sand. Soft dry sand requires your stabilizer muscles to work harder. Much of your movement and power will be slowed with the resistance and challenge of sand.

Sand offers great terrain to improve balance and stability, all with minimal joint impact. Running on sand can burn up to 30% more calories than on pavement or hard surface. Because technical movements are more challenging in the sand, athletes develop quicker reflexes and expend more energy keeping a ball in play.\n\nIf you are new to this beach-style workout, start first on wet sand. Soft dry sand requires your stabilizer muscles to work harder. Much of your movement and power will be slowed with the resistance and challenge of sand. As with any outdoor activity, stay well hydrated, avoid peak hours of sun, and apply SPF 15 or higher. Stay aware of heat exhaustion symptoms for you and those around you.

When life gets hard, stressful, or boring, the easy escape is often the fridge. Turning to food to feed our feelings doesn\'t fix the underlying problem. Identify what triggers your emotional eating, and replace eating with a different coping mechanism like a quick walk, yoga, or drinking water.\r\n\r\nEmotional hunger often strikes suddenly. Instead of immediately reaching for comfort food, consider if you are truly hungry, or if you are just craving food in response to emotion.\r\n\r\nBeing mindful of the true hunger sensation takes practice and control. Try drinking water, as hunger is often confused for thirst, or give yourself the apple test.

When life gets hard, stressful, or boring, the easy escape is often the fridge. Turning to food to feed our feelings doesn\'t fix the underlying problem. Identify what triggers your emotional eating, and replace eating with a different coping mechanism like a quick walk, yoga, or drinking water.\r\n\r\nEmotional hunger often strikes suddenly. Instead of immediately reaching for comfort food, consider if you are truly hungry, or if you are just craving food in response to emotion.\r\n\r\nBeing mindful of the true hunger sensation takes practice and control. Try drinking water, as hunger is often confused for thirst, or give yourself the apple test. Ask, \"If all I had right now was an apple, would I eat it?\" If the answer is no, identify the emotional need you are trying to satisfy. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001X6b8VibYHSRJSkMGa2g8a5KAfx1e9gLZh6XqHVGjAdf5HarKQKzeXgZC50Hc7j6_OOuAOajDZCRHgOPr4uW0PT7kAfFhmN1Z6qGmrLKP0xQgxmVnIN9MeoXRWO4zWAS2aq5KhNjOUPAht7oUHLTnotadPkOpAfU-QYjaPLN9dQgX87C4CD14URiS_Js7_aax\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More</em></a>', 'Overcoming Emotional Eating', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1901-revision-2', '', '', '2014-01-08 21:06:54', '2014-01-08 21:06:54', '', '1901', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/1901-revision-2/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Adding or removing layers as needed will help you stay warm and dry while staying active.\r\n\r\n<strong>Base Layer: </strong>This layer, closest to your skin, should wick moisture away from your body and into the air or outer layer where it can evaporate. The best base layer materials are lightweight synthetics like polypropylene and polyester.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mid-Layer: </strong>This insulating layer helps to take moisture away from the base layer. Wool and synthetics, such as fleece, work well. This layer should be snug but not constricting. Features such as full-length front zippers allow for venting.\r\n\r\n<strong>Outer Layer: </strong>This layer protects you from the elements. When it\'s dry outside, go for a lightweight soft shell that provides warmth, breathability, and wind resistance. If the conditions are wet, make sure your outer layer is both breathable and waterproof. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001X6b8VibYHSQbdkNuUPNciY9ASlJN8GJXSxQ-xQp4E0e48CYkRmLE-1JcoiS0l55U-k7xVHSahioJ4WPl8fuS4ctSs3_XPnxg3F2yU8XsWuryf6v23_J0cjaz0qg7wqK_6mgIeQzBNiAzwJOearztKzSsQl-K-fm5mZyL0bH5HCsp_yiN6kLWue6QjdTlLqysIaJUUeF4z3JtUrGliRP6ujaEEjM-c4C_\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More</em></a>', 'Bundled Up for Outdoor Fitness ', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'bundled-up-for-outdoor-fitness', '', '', '2014-01-08 21:08:34', '2014-01-08 21:08:34', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=1906', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Medical experts have compared the risks of excessive sitting to the same dangerous effects of smoking including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and depression.\r\n\r\nDaily exercise isn\'t enough to counteract prolonged sitting. New research shows the benefits of 30-60 minutes of exercise may be undone if you sit the rest of the day. Sitting slows the metabolism, reduces circulation, and raises blood sugar. Just three hours less of sitting each day could add two years to your life expectancy!\r\n\r\nIf you\'re stuck to your seat at work, set reminders to move every hour. Take a stand against sitting by walking a lap around the office, standing while on the phone, and taking frequent stretching and water breaks. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001kCurY-oSC7aFMT9v85w4Xt43rkfAIhAb3MZzG_3OaCc_MeHEG0nRuV_gI8xf2m5Xc_7_ryIux4mWlkS_GoWdoVLYmTFGuZemLbypUNxU125QGfleBPw5s42N_nsm1oSv1fqRgAlLGSywfTwEEEVRnm7Y8kXfqda9GTLkwZ1MJBw=\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More</em></a>', 'The Sitting Disease Epidemic', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-sitting-disease-epidemic', '', '', '2014-02-06 22:19:51', '2014-02-06 22:19:51', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=1924', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Simply providing chest compressions to someone in cardiac arrest is a safe and effective way for a bystander to double or triple a person\'s chances of survival. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001kCurY-oSC7Z7Syub2HDvhW5MXYQJobYCsSyBVP6Cy36KwvKWC7yVWPWjnkHhwKaLUN5XIdtuQ5rC0UlWFLoQ42XSVokiUbrDKPviGkSML4jaWpHGGRXxJ1JRgJO1zcygmHiYz11NMY7kbREJzO1_C2BLFEZZaj76_Js5qIyc7NkM_3J8JbRIzLElEAFW5uC_XAK1-AqXLYU5QSM1DR15iXBlTQadFeUo\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More</em></a>', 'Save a Life with Hands-Only CPR', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1926-revision-2', '', '', '2014-02-06 22:20:53', '2014-02-06 22:20:53', '', '1926', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/1926-revision-2/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Pale skin, cold extremities, and shortness of breath may also indicate anemia.\r\n\r\nIron-deficiency anemia can be caused from blood loss due to injury, blood donation, or surgery. The best food sources for iron include red meat, poultry, and fish. Other foods high in iron include leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale, beans and lentils, and iron-fortified cereals. Eating foods high in vitamin C along with iron-rich foods can help your body absorb iron.\r\n\r\nA simple blood test can determine if you are anemic. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms and possible iron supplementation. Sterling Wellness offers discounted lab testing for anemia at a lab in your area. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001faST2-npQdIWHoHhVUqn8nrYcyj1Xp12KzkC12qNMSeCKKwZUA4xCBWiIskFtarpnvgS11RF2x9qCpKUdyrCM3PrntlnaNB1cYpyuXkobf47qmQ-aaqCXFdpAsxk-vXn59ppROz0y4EZ58aPm4raBbmtpqLAQ9bXZ-ZGNidaX4MZRnYeEZfW0UQWjSlccTPV6-flvc7eVanQnHPc9E89SA==&amp;c=cJsFEUnx96J6U561bIYsXKWgyNu_MhAgoWhjFzOUOQRqGyU586RI0A==&amp;ch=y7rWogukMK-b8iCn2XuS2HPo1B_dk5QVCFXqApnPX259OEZSxytYIw==\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> or call our office at 1-800-838-0337 for more information. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001faST2-npQdIWHoHhVUqn8nrYcyj1Xp12KzkC12qNMSeCKKwZUA4xCBWiIskFtarpkbz0JmAXM61PzkKc_2vYPX5hh6iJnBmkha8BZSXbqrZm2gBOwghaAbh086c1QQP3HX8Lk8GMFDr5jmyCuyXqya2_tGOuMMm1mnyBtxcAEKTOs-3OO45ZjBsJkTrgURWy_OMBYtC2NizzRIa-JpcKvMgq3gqdSOfS&amp;c=cJsFEUnx96J6U561bIYsXKWgyNu_MhAgoWhjFzOUOQRqGyU586RI0A==&amp;ch=y7rWogukMK-b8iCn2XuS2HPo1B_dk5QVCFXqApnPX259OEZSxytYIw==\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More</em></a>', 'Iron-Deficiency Anemia', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', '2064', '', '', '2014-08-08 16:41:58', '2014-08-08 16:41:58', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=2064', '0', 'post', '', '0');

When your body doesn\'t have enough healthy red blood cells, or if those cells are lacking in iron-rich hemoglobin, your body can\'t get the oxygen it needs making you feel tired. Pale skin, cold extremities, and shortness of breath may also indicate anemia.\r\n\r\nIron-deficiency anemia can be caused from blood loss due to injury, blood donation, or surgery. The best food sources for iron include red meat, poultry, and fish. Other foods high in iron include leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale, beans and lentils, and iron-fortified cereals. Eating foods high in vitamin C along with iron-rich foods can help your body absorb iron.\r\n\r\nA simple blood test can determine if you are anemic.

Their sweet juicy similarities allow most stone fruits to be used interchangeably in recipes. Peaches, nectarines, and apricots contain anthocyanin and quercetin.

Regular exercise can lower breast cancer risk by about 10-20%. The American Cancer Society recommends 150 minutes, or 2.5 hours, of exercise each week to lower overall cancer risk.\r\nNot only does exercise help with weight control and obesity, a risk factor for breast cancer, but it can also lower estrogen levels in women, adding another layer of protection. Furthermore, exercise can boost the body\'s immune system to help kill or slow the growth of cancer cells. A large study by the Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers &amp; Prevention showed that breast cancer survivors who got activity equal to a 30-minute brisk walk several times a week had 40% lower risk of breast cancer death compared to less active survivors. Women who get more activity see more benefits. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001flEtcTDLdOZcCASGWG2VlPx97V89fa9a8Y9fj5vfE-95eQU-99N_cxRgdmthzEcKyHhm87iB17J4QF2opp0btDni2BHyQe-jtdIgcmOr-EVlrM8bzWcIOtQ4ix26n0po1IPl_97TjQIDq9NZoxdde134k1k6BsrT8JbjkNm9RG9VzuWUfR8agQ3HytSN0_Ec-m8w57wy1QY8A2sVNUBd1g==&amp;c=BQa7v_ihdbetQOubnidRuCxNBdY5cOYTZ-bKQPFWeEm78-8UCQbUZg==&amp;ch=ApL6b9g-7RJ41hLsF2jiTI6_uerR0NpJcT16c8eaiIyrSi1JNj6MBA==\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More</em></a>\r\n\r\n<!-- </img> -->', 'Battling Breast Cancer Through Exercise', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2096-revision-3', '', '', '2014-10-09 16:06:03', '2014-10-09 16:06:03', '', '2096', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/2096-revision-3/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

In short, it\'s exhaled into thin air. That\'s right, about 84% of fat burned is converted into carbon dioxide and breathed out through the lungs. The remaining 16% becomes water that is excreted out of the body through sweat and bodily functions.\r\n\r\nTo lose fat, science still proves you must burn more calories than you are consuming. One pound of fat is equivalent to 3,500 calories, so in order to lose one pound, you must create a 3,500 calorie deficit through eating less or exercising more. Cutting 500 calories from the diet each day adds up to a 3,500 calorie deficit in one week. It\'s much easier to consume calories than it is to burn them, so balancing weight loss efforts with both diet and exercise will produce better results. Resistance exercises like weight lifting and strength training can increase the metabolism to burn more calories even at rest, so aim to include strengthening exercise 2-3 times a week. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001QEdfrCk38wc9wGKG4KqGASpzDdjqzdVDpUpcCL7yY2NN2EtlkgGqaa_B0jGbsra5jMvXl4T1TU3ieubvo4zGyvGBFTbX1lyw0ozqRotVUC_dtvswctB05Efd5t3r3CQL1UMCqQGCYH5swoCWNQsT6JiSb9D1kpsVt0IxYEgJCZ6N_-LpR5TSjuzP_Iry-2bcui_9iaCzJ1nw2hK8yVBM-2uXhAAr5lPdf3nbnGqOFgE=&amp;c=nSXqgoINyKvY866MZQoeTgKSb7tIhZcdXixL2kfeBGIs5wAjbJHkqA==&amp;ch=EgjAxqWueYi4QKp9JlhsQ2kjwOzV0kziAu1YL_xIJq8VA4Ihr3brFQ==\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More</em></a>', 'The Disappearing Act of Fat', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-disappearing-act-of-fat', '', '', '2015-01-21 20:31:11', '2015-01-21 20:31:11', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=2162', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Children ages 8-18 consume an average of 7.5 hours of screen media per day which leads to obesity, high blood pressure, and irregular sleep patterns in kids. Adults who spend at least 4 hours of leisure time in front of a TV are twice as likely to have a heart attack. Screen time for children is especially habit-forming. Studies show the more time children are in front of screens, the harder time they have turning them off as they become older.

Children ages 8-18 consume an average of 7.5 hours of screen media per day which leads to obesity, high blood pressure, and irregular sleep patterns in kids. Adults who spend at least 4 hours of leisure time in front of a TV are twice as likely to have a heart attack. Screen time for children is especially habit-forming. Studies show the more time children are in front of screens, the harder time they have turning them off as they become older. Children consume on average almost 170 additional calories per day for every hour they watch TV.\n\nWith obesity on the rise in children and adults, take active steps to limit screen time in your family.

Recognizing the early warning signs of a heart attack is critical in improving the odds of survival. The most common sign of a heart attack in both men and women is chest pain or discomfort that comes on quickly, goes away, and then comes back. Although both genders experience similar warning signs, there are often slight differences in the signs of a heart attack between men and women:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Women </strong>may show less obvious symptoms and are more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting. Women may experience unusual tiredness for days, and pain in the back, shoulders, or jaw.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Men</strong> are more likely to experience upper body discomfort in one or both arms, shortness of breath and the hallmark chest pain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeing aware of the different possible symptoms of a heart attack is equally important in both genders for prompt medical intervention. If you think you or someone around you is experiencing a heart attack, your first step should be to contact 911. Simply providing chest compressions to someone in cardiac arrest is a safe and effective way for a bystander to provide life-saving techniques. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0017mQ0Vc9mTDayFEc5IUUHkUY6YeDaODTbYps_BuCFoJMOHhp6JwtqYr2oaer1evNuE8ipgbvJ7aTQZKoaUjRjLqy9XwSq5tefODgO20IkSy2oFtIP2pCm-dN9fZyJEGVCN05UTgF0D5rlF7xYqFa1yUrk-Mh5sGVDA8PpUvL28mXAOCaaMM1o-rGIffshzKwPbozJs65gzJw8xnngYPIAbQbwiH2Q3cxzRF3t7imRaxxlSHa06OvGUN26DxsqAKoz-sk0gRqGqnDHt0kNNBPUJQ==&amp;c=7kuIi6nbcTS4KiiKEBSTgbdPa3ftbimuf4k16i1FNU9V3ULGVwbfYQ==&amp;ch=ozkcvucfpT9MG5m3KdXxOTGo7_ZcgY8FarDYLgtYwrTS_vtQouxHVQ==\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More</em></a>', 'Heart Attack Symptoms by Gender', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'heart-attack-symptoms-by-gender', '', '', '2015-02-26 20:31:40', '2015-02-26 20:31:40', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=2188', '0', 'post', '', '0');

For adults, emphasis is typically placed on lower body exercises like jump squats, box jumps, and agility drills. Upper body plyometrics typically include a medicine ball. Two to three days between plyometric exercises are essential to allow for recovery in the muscle tissue. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0017mQ0Vc9mTDayFEc5IUUHkUY6YeDaODTbYps_BuCFoJMOHhp6JwtqYravzpza4PkSfD108zuvJuIgTVZ7kQ44yIIbKW85Hyfctd4snK2bgYAwEgk2JLBFLr-lNdz0kB2xE2-cU3N6-hX4cQpReG6alfLAIP4J201aSUROimv6mcTByZrXpR2QGSCS_yvGaR6boJhc1efkMBMEFrfF9JlUy9Cj8kpuCGJOpOQEahQtMTHlAVRknQ6sGEjFzi4Fa3VvXwtNT6N212s=&amp;c=7kuIi6nbcTS4KiiKEBSTgbdPa3ftbimuf4k16i1FNU9V3ULGVwbfYQ==&amp;ch=ozkcvucfpT9MG5m3KdXxOTGo7_ZcgY8FarDYLgtYwrTS_vtQouxHVQ==\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><em>More</em></a>', 'Jump into Plyometrics', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'jump-into-plyometrics', '', '', '2015-02-26 20:32:17', '2015-02-26 20:32:17', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=2190', '0', 'post', '', '0');

However, consumers are still left with mind-boggling choices based on the source, farming practices, and nutrition of eggs:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Brown eggs</strong> are nearly identical in nutritional value as white eggs even though the brown variety are often marketed as being healthier. The color of the eggshell is determined solely by the color of the hen laying the egg.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Organic eggs</strong> come from antibiotic-free and hormone-free chickens that eat only organic grain grown on land free from pesticides and fertilizers for at least 3 years.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Free-Range eggs</strong> come from chickens that are allowed to roam freely outdoors.

The carpal tunnel is an anatomical passageway for the nerve that controls feeling to the palm and fingers. When that nerve gets compressed due to inflammation, illness, or poor ergonomics, pain and numbness can occur. Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually start gradually with tingling and numbness in the index, middle, and ring fingers and hand.\r\n\r\nEarly diagnosis and treatment can prevent permanent damage. Many people who develop carpal tunnel syndrome can reverse the damage without surgery. Putting the wrist in a splint, over the counter anti-inflammatory drugs, and ice packs can help with inflammation and pain. Workers should take frequent breaks from repetitive activities to stretch the palms, fingers, and wrist often.

Stretch at least 2-3 times a week, and always after exercising once muscles are warm. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001ifDocx7sEl8O4OqBmlnLntYnann2-SHHYnevnveP4LgEZsN7D8StpZ1zRJ7CWUhxlqHyA3l8cwFNLBelAYSW4MA2RyTe4gQEJLNJJa98EQKktriBn9pKj-AzFiqa1gxNBf4HPdT3QkQ2CMHuD52hWiiC2BEnmB6zWfmbV6R-e66bpXRVtITgVerkAfXRpZR85R_g_AxZNTQ=&amp;c=s4ugFE-FmHqmsE8qZmqyHnF5tXgXR7E8lo45Da6M7-9WRMUjZzXnfQ==&amp;ch=R1d81_NR-gXMVvpUwqOU3AgxAIJO2NLIKON3fMYW5cgxguqp5Trx-w==\">Short stretching videos</a> can energize you in the home or workplace. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001ifDocx7sEl8O4OqBmlnLntYnann2-SHHYnevnveP4LgEZsN7D8StpYq1WQJoqchPT1xKuPn3NdOOkffoCyMee3B3Oe_I4ciXnmipPC-CmvR2Wsn-vrvw0OW-cb7nrcGin6dgAuvFz3ri0Jl8RAECKmboAZjvpmXsxHe1rnTBrLlg-hI1O4VBN3PXi70pX2tJuPCnFRpG_wFMaXbl0f4Ttwssy59Il_3CV0BgWDGSXDnOpPdev7dJIQ==&amp;c=s4ugFE-FmHqmsE8qZmqyHnF5tXgXR7E8lo45Da6M7-9WRMUjZzXnfQ==&amp;ch=R1d81_NR-gXMVvpUwqOU3AgxAIJO2NLIKON3fMYW5cgxguqp5Trx-w==\"><em>More</em></a>', 'Stretch, Flex, and Bend', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2346-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-08-13 12:51:03', '2015-08-13 18:51:03', '', '2346', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/2346-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Additionally, smaller fish toward the bottom of the food chain like sardines have less chance of mercury build up than larger fish like shark and mackerel. Shellfish like lobster, crawfish, crab, and shrimp do not offer as much heart-healthy benefit and should be limited for those who have high cholesterol. Much of the health benefits of fish are dependent on how it is prepared. Grilling or baking fish is generally recommended over frying. One serving of fish is approximately 3 ounces, or about the size of a deck of cards. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001ifDocx7sEl8O4OqBmlnLntYnann2-SHHYnevnveP4LgEZsN7D8StpZ1zRJ7CWUhxirlfCSwM4LWsj2faI7adSwzCSDuXnK5XzNQ0M25IV1uZAtI33Ee3IzbIU4KmjckdkK90BQEP1hlMUlvIi55UcpOFpCEger65lbMWcCcCjeY8_wvi-O_SMJd0cW0_NhQF-CSFnGIyA2iYSqzi8LjbqjQ8-MR7q7n-sVsklynwS2eYohm-u4afLvaAZQSgKgnyJpcQ0gXU2ZDVcv45IUniAYWIC_d_Nmn851HArwMlgDp6zvjCqjjM06kCRdu5QQ69&amp;c=s4ugFE-FmHqmsE8qZmqyHnF5tXgXR7E8lo45Da6M7-9WRMUjZzXnfQ==&amp;ch=R1d81_NR-gXMVvpUwqOU3AgxAIJO2NLIKON3fMYW5cgxguqp5Trx-w==\"><em>More</em></a>', 'Fishin\' for Nutrition', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2343-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-08-13 12:54:24', '2015-08-13 18:54:24', '', '2343', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/2343-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Hit the stairs! Any indoor staircase, stadium bleachers, or even a hill will do. Climbing stairs improves leg strength for all major muscles in the lower body. It also improves bone density, aerobic lung capacity, and builds a stronger heart to deliver oxygen to muscles, making everyday tasks seem less tiring.\r\nThe weight loss benefits of stair climbing can significantly add up as well. Taking the stairs burns twice as many calories as walking, and 8-9 times more than taking an elevator.

Hit the stairs! Any indoor staircase, stadium bleachers, or even a hill will do. Climbing stairs improves leg strength for all major muscles in the lower body. It also improves bone density, aerobic lung capacity, and builds a stronger heart to deliver oxygen to muscles, making everyday tasks seem less tiring.\r\nThe weight loss benefits of stair climbing can significantly add up as well. Taking the stairs burns twice as many calories as walking, and 8-9 times more than taking an elevator.

Resiliency is the ability to adapt well over time after potentially stressful or traumatic life-changing events. Bouncing back from a difficult time doesn\'t mean a person hasn\'t walked through emotional pain or distress, but rather they are adapting to the setback and working to overcome adversity. To build resilience:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Reach out to others and accept support from those willing to help.</li>\r\n	<li>Accept what you can\'t change, but change how you react.</li>\r\n	<li>Find meaning in things that give you a sense of accomplishment and purpose.</li>\r\n	<li>Take care of your physical health through exercise and rest.</li>\r\n	<li>Maintain a positive outlook of yourself and stay optimistic of the good things that will come in the future.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen self-help and mental toughness aren\'t enough, professional help can keep you functioning through a tough time and help with anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001PboQc0qUVyji43QGlZipBEpBwr1EVVWeHQ44fHxt3DpbN_gRoEx921cAdGyaKwsMGTM4X_tOCLrjMr69N-7CNtN23r3egK13usIufa0pUpIFatM9s8Cvc17tK7f_yOgPSV3sZ_m2_Ery-D8ZwLsdHRzGXvvyQdKD0BT2BPEruS0WaLz_cTf0neaRmOn5_GRJpmfDfyDJUwkMMuBtbn9RStHQIZOa4vcevhBvQefNjFWb0kvHE4WhzmoUNv-rZjvcPT_RG1C8tXQ1RBshqI8wE0ncdYBJK1HG&amp;c=5aH9Yz5McRf1Ar-uaa_atp7q0U5kWxYtWO0XEch4lqI-Ayq0juJtEg==&amp;ch=F6TqsZ750kKJCkNMVKTvqYLQpmI4Xq_cYmD8dEsTBUhA1T_TkO4XmQ==\"><em>More</em></a>', 'The Road to Resiliency', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-road-to-resiliency', '', '', '2015-10-22 08:42:01', '2015-10-22 14:42:01', '', '0', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/?p=2377', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Resiliency is the ability to adapt well over time after potentially stressful or traumatic life-changing events. Bouncing back from a difficult time doesn\'t mean a person hasn\'t walked through emotional pain or distress, but rather they are adapting to the setback and working to overcome adversity. To build resilience:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Reach out to others and accept support from those willing to help.</li>\r\n	<li>Accept what you can\'t change, but change how you react.</li>\r\n	<li>Find meaning in things that give you a sense of accomplishment and purpose.</li>\r\n	<li>Take care of your physical health through exercise and rest.</li>\r\n	<li>Maintain a positive outlook of yourself and stay optimistic of the good things that will come in the future.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen self-help and mental toughness aren\'t enough, professional help can keep you functioning through a tough time and help with anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001PboQc0qUVyji43QGlZipBEpBwr1EVVWeHQ44fHxt3DpbN_gRoEx921cAdGyaKwsMGTM4X_tOCLrjMr69N-7CNtN23r3egK13usIufa0pUpIFatM9s8Cvc17tK7f_yOgPSV3sZ_m2_Ery-D8ZwLsdHRzGXvvyQdKD0BT2BPEruS0WaLz_cTf0neaRmOn5_GRJpmfDfyDJUwkMMuBtbn9RStHQIZOa4vcevhBvQefNjFWb0kvHE4WhzmoUNv-rZjvcPT_RG1C8tXQ1RBshqI8wE0ncdYBJK1HG&amp;c=5aH9Yz5McRf1Ar-uaa_atp7q0U5kWxYtWO0XEch4lqI-Ayq0juJtEg==&amp;ch=F6TqsZ750kKJCkNMVKTvqYLQpmI4Xq_cYmD8dEsTBUhA1T_TkO4XmQ==\"><em>More</em></a>', 'The Road to Resiliency', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '2377-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-10-22 08:42:01', '2015-10-22 14:42:01', '', '2377', 'http://www.sterling-wellness.com/2377-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');
